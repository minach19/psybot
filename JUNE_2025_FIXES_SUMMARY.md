# PsyBot Avatar System - Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Uncaught ReferenceError: setupEventListeners is not defined"
- **Problem**: The `setupEventListeners()` function was being called in avatar-mood-functions.js but was not defined anywhere.
- **Fix**: Created a new `setupEventListeners()` function in avatar-mood-functions.js that properly sets up event listeners for the avatar mood system.
- **File modified**: `c:\xampp\htdocs\psybot\static\js\avatar-mood-functions.js`

### 2. "POST http://localhost:5000/save_avatar.php 404 (NOT FOUND)"
- **Problem**: When running on Flask development server (localhost:5000), the code was trying to access /save_avatar.php on the Flask server, which doesn't exist.
- **Fix**: Updated the avatar save path logic to detect if the app is running on Flask dev server and use the correct XAMPP URL in that case.
- **File modified**: `c:\xampp\htdocs\psybot\static\js\avatar-customizer.js`

### 3. "Required elements not found: {quote: false, quoteText: false}"
- **Problem**: The motivational quote function was expecting DOM elements that don't exist.
- **Fix**: Updated `getMotivationalQuote()` function to dynamically create the required elements if they don't exist.
- **File modified**: `c:\xampp\htdocs\psybot\static\js\main.js`

### 4. "Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy"
- **Problem**: When running on Flask development server (localhost:5000) and trying to access PHP files on XAMPP server (localhost), CORS policy was blocking the requests.
- **Fix**: Enhanced CORS headers in PHP files and updated the JavaScript fetch requests to properly handle CORS.
- **Files modified**:
  - `c:\xampp\htdocs\psybot\save_avatar.php`
  - `c:\xampp\htdocs\psybot\load_avatar.php`
  - `c:\xampp\htdocs\psybot\static\js\avatar-customizer.js`

## Testing

Several test files have been created to verify all fixes:

1. `c:\xampp\htdocs\psybot\fix_verification_test.html` - Tests the original fixes:
   - Test for the setupEventListeners function
   - Test for the avatar save path logic
   - Test for the motivational quote functionality

2. `c:\xampp\htdocs\psybot\cors_test_improved.html` - Specifically tests CORS functionality:
   - Tests saving avatars across different origins
   - Tests loading avatars across different origins
   - Tests preflight CORS requests
   - Provides server information for debugging

## Additional Notes

- The modifications maintain compatibility with existing code
- Error handling has been improved to provide better diagnostics
- Dynamic element creation has been implemented where appropriate to make the code more robust
- The avatar system should now work correctly in both Flask development mode and when running via XAMPP
- Enhanced CORS support allows seamless communication between Flask and XAMPP servers

## How to Test

### Prerequisites:
1. XAMPP Apache server must be running
2. Flask development server must be running on port 5000

### Testing Steps:
1. Open the main app: http://localhost:5000
2. Open verification test: http://localhost/psybot/fix_verification_test.html
3. Open CORS test: http://localhost/psybot/cors_test_improved.html

### CORS Troubleshooting:
If you still experience CORS issues:
1. Check that both servers are running
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for specific error messages
4. Verify CORS headers in network responses
